# simple-docs
A web app for creating documents. The frontend is built using reactjs. The main editor is built using slate-js, which is a reactjs framework for creating editors.

The plan is to create a full-fledged docs application with a good rich-text editor having multiple styles and the feature of live editing with collaborators.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` in the code directory.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app.
